<p>Some facts about me: <br> I like Star Wars...like a lot!<br> I enjoy skateboarding & biking during my free time with my family.<br>I plan on pursuing a career in website and app development.<br>Finally, during quarantine I've just learned how to fast for a long period of time and it has made me feel more alive in a healthy way </p>
<p>Favorite Foods: <br>To be honest with you, I don't have a favorite I equally like all foods from all over the world. But, if I had to choose my top 3 they would be: <br>Japanese<br>Chinese<br>Hawaiian<br>Korean</p>
